## Features

- Input Validation: The form includes validation rules for different fields, such as full name, phone number, email address, website URL, and password. It checks for criteria such as minimum length, maximum length, numeric patterns, and password complexity. Inline HTML validation attributes are utilized to enforce these rules.

- Firebase Integration: The website leverages Firebase, a backend service, to handle form submission and data storage. Upon successful validation, the user's information is securely sent to Firebase for further processing.

- Responsive Design: The website incorporates a responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
